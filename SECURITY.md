# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of Inyoka is supported.
(Mainly, as Inyoka is a hobby project and only maintained by volunteers in their free-time.)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you suspect a security vulnerability:
[Private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) is enabled.
Please use this Github functionality to report security issues privately.

Alternatively, send a mail to security@inyokaproject.org.

We treat security issues confidential until coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
We try to respond to your report within 2 weeks.

We don't have an own bug bounty program for Inyoka. Nevertheless, we thank you to make the world a safer place!
