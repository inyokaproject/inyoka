@paste
Feature: Paste
  Inyoka provides also a module to manage pastes.


  Scenario: Users should be able to find a connection to the paste from the main page
    Given I am on the "main" page
     Then I should see a link to "paste.BASE_DOMAIN_NAME"


  Scenario Outline: Users should see a list of created pastes if they have the permission to do so
    Given I am "<username>"
      And I have the permission "pastebin.view_entry"
      And a "paste" with caption "BDD-TEST" exists
     When I use the "pastebin" and visit the "main" page
     Then I should see a "paste" with "BDD-TEST" in a list

    Examples:
      | username  |
      | anonymous |
      | BDD-User  |


  Scenario Outline: Users should see an exception if they shouldn't see entries
    Given I am "<username>"
     When I use the "pastebin" and visit the "main" page
     Then I should see a "403" exception

    Examples:
      | username  |

    Given I am "<username>"
      And a "paste" with caption "BDD-TEST" exists
      And I have the permission "pastebin.view_entry"
     When I open the "pastebin" in detail view
     Then I should see a title "BDD-TEST"
      And I should see elements with values
       | element      | value    |
       | entry_author | bdd      |

  Scenario Outline: Users shouldn't see the details of a paste if they haven't got the permission
    Given I am "<username>"
      And a "paste" with caption "BDD-TEST" exists
     When I open the "pastebin" in <view_type> view
     Then I should see a "403" exception
