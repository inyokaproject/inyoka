Supported Versions
==================

Only the latest version of Inyoka is supported.
(Mainly, as Inyoka is a hobby project and only maintained by volunteers in their free-time.)

Reporting a Vulnerability
=========================

If you suspect a security vulnerability:
`Private vulnerability reporting <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability>`_ is enabled.
Please use this Github functionality to report security issues privately.

Alternatively, send a mail to ``security@inyokaproject.org``.

We treat security issues confidential until coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
We try to respond to your report within 2 weeks.

We dont have an own bug bounty program for Inyoka. Nevertheless, we thank you to make the world a safer place!
