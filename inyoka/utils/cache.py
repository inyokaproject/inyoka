    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The caching infrastructure of Inyoka.

    On top of the django cache client that speaks directly to either redis
    or caches in-memory we have a :class:`RequestCache` that caches
    redis-commands in a thread-local dictionary.  This saves a lot of
    redis-commands in some scenarios.
