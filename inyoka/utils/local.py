    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    All kinds of request local magic.  This module provides two objects:

    `local`
        a werkzeug local object bound to the current request.

    `current_request`
        A proxy to the current active request object.

    The purpose of this module is to allow functions to access request data
    in the context of a request without explicitly passing the request object.
