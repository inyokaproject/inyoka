    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This module handles security levels for the wiki.  The system uses the
    wiki storage to store the patterns.  Whenever the data is loaded from the
    wiki pages that hold access control information the `storage` module
    splits the data already into easy processable data.

    This is an important detail because the ACL module knows nothing about the
    names of the privileges on the frontend.  Internally the names of the
    privileges are mapped to integer flags.

    All privilege functions consume either the privilege flags or the internal
    short name of the privilege.  The shortnames are specified in the
    `privilege_map` dict and different from the user interface which uses
    translated versions of the variables.

    Because metadata is part of a page the views have to check if the metadata
    changed in a way the user is not allowed to change it.  This module
    provides a function called `test_changes_allowed` that checks for that.
