    inyoka.utils.macros
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The module contains the core macros and the logic to find macros.

    The term macro is derived from the MoinMoin wiki engine which refers to
    macros as small pieces of dynamic snippets that are exanded at rendering
    time.  For inyoka macros are pretty much the same just they are always
    expanded at parsing time.  However, for the sake of dynamics macros can
    mark themselves as runtime macros.  In that case during parsing the macro
    is inserted directly into the parsing as as block (or inline, depending on
    the macro settings) node and called once the data is loaded from the
    serialized instructions.

    This leads to the limitation that macros must be pickleable.  So if you
    feel the urge of creating a closure or something similar in your macro
    initializer remember that and move the code into the render method.

    For example macro implementations have a look at this module's sourcecode
    which implements all the builtin macros.
